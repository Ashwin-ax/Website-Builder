# Simple Drag and Drop Website Builder

Hi!

This is a small project I made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no libraries or frameworks). It is a basic website builder where you can drag and drop elements like text, images, and buttons into a blank canvas. You can also edit those elements using a small form.

## Features

- Drag and drop **Text**, **Image**, and **Button** on the canvas
- Click any added element to open a form where you can:
  - Change the text
  - Change font size and text color
  - Update image URL and image width
- Clean and simple UI
- Mobile-friendly layout

## How it Works

- You pick an item from the left sidebar and drag it to the center canvas.
- Once added, you can click the element to open a small editor on the right.
- The editor lets you change the properties of the selected element.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. Start dragging elements, and there you go

## Files

- `index.html` – Main HTML page
- `style.css` – Styles for layout
- `script.js` – All JavaScript logic for drag, drop, and editing

## Future Ideas

- Save the layout to local storage
- Export the design as HTML
- Add more element types and styles
